# Remix v2

We're _**so**_ excited to release Remix v2 to you and we really hope this upgrade is one of the smoothest framework upgrades you've ever experienced! That was our primary goal with v2 - something we aimed to achieve through a heavy use of deprecation warnings and [Future Flags](https://remix.run/blog/future-flags) in Remix v1.

If you are on the latest `1.x` version and you've enabled all future flags and addressed all console warnings, then our hope is that you are 90% of the way to being upgraded for v2. There are always going to be a few things that we _can't_ put behind a flag (like breaking type changes) or come up at the very last moment and don't have time to add as a warning or flag in `1.x`.

If you're _not_ yet on the latest 1.x version we'd recommend first upgrading to that and resolving any flag/console warnings:

```sh
> npx upgrade-remix 1.19.3
```

## Breaking Changes

Below is a _very concise_ list of the breaking changes in v2.

- For the most thorough discussion of breaking changes, please read the [**Preparing for v2**][preparingforv2] guide. This document provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the breaking changes that come along with v2 - and instructions on how to adapt your application to handle them
- For additional details, you can refer to the [Changes by Package][changesbypackage] section below

### Upgraded Dependency Requirements

Remix v2 has upgraded it's minimum version support for React and Node and now officially supports:

- React 18 ([#7121](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7121))
  - For information on upgrading to React 18, please see the React [upgrade guide][react18upgrade]
- Node 18 or later ([#6939](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6939), [#7292](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7292))
  - For information on upgrading to Node 18, please see the Node [v18 announcement][node18upgrade]
  - Please refer to the [Remix documentation][nodeversionsupport] for an overview of when we drop support for Node versions

### Removed Future Flags

The following future flags were removed and their behavior is now the default - you can remove all of these from your `remix.config.js` file.

- [`v2_dev`][v2dev] - New dev server with HMR+HDR ([#7002](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7002))
  - If you had configurations in `future.v2_dev` instead of just the boolean value (i.e., `future.v2_dev.port`), you can lift them into a root `dev` object in your `remix.config.js`
- [`v2_errorBoundary`][v2errorboundary] - Removed `CatchBoundary` in favor of a singular `ErrorBoundary` ([#6906](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6906))
- [`v2_headers`][v2headers] - Altered the logic for `headers` in nested route scenarios ([#6979](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6979))
- [`v2_meta`][v2meta] - Altered the return format of `meta()` ([#6958](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6958))
- [`v2_normalizeFormMethod`][v2normalizeformmethod] - Normalize `formMethod` APIs to uppercase ([#6875](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6875))
- [`v2_routeConvention`][v2routeconvention] - Routes use a flat route convention by default now ([#6969](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6969))

### Breaking Changes/API Removals

#### With deprecation warnings

The following lists other breaking changes/API removals which had deprecation warnings in Remix v1. If you're on the latest `1.19.3` release without any console warnings, then you're probably good to go on all of these!

- `remix.config.js`
  - Renamed [`browserBuildDirectory`][browserbuilddirectory] to `assetsBuildDirectory` ([#6900](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6900))

    - Note that if you are opting into this in a `1.x` release, your config flag will be `future.v2_dev.port`, but on a stable `2.x` release it will be `dev.port`

- `@remix-run/react`
  - Removed [`useTransition`][usetransition] ([#6870](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6870))

#### Breaking Type Changes

- Removed `V2_` prefixes from `future.v2_meta` types as they are now the default behavior ([#6958](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6958))
  - `V2_MetaArgs` -> `MetaArgs`

  - Renamed the `useMatches()` return type from `RouteMatch` to `UIMatch`
  - Renamed `LoaderArgs`/`ActionArgs` to `LoaderFunctionArgs`/`ActionFunctionArgs`
  - `AppData` changed from `any` to `unknown`
  - `Location["state"]` (`useLocation.state`) changed from `any` to `unknown`
  - `UIMatch["data"]` (`useMatches()[i].data`) changed from `any` to `unknown`
  - `UIMatch["handle"]` (`useMatches()[i].handle`) changed from `{ [k: string]: any }` to `unknown`

  - `MetaMatch.handle` (used in `meta()`) changed from `any` to `unknown`
  - `AppData`/`RouteHandle` are no longer exported as they are just aliases for `unknown`

## New Features

- New [`create-remix`][createremix] CLI ([#6887](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6887))
  - Most notably, this removes the dropdown to choose your template/stack in favor of the `--template` flag and our ever-growing list of [available templates][templates]
  - Adds a new `--overwrite` flag ([#7062](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7062))
  - Supports the `bun` package manager ([#7074](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7074))
- Detect built mode via `build.mode` ([#6964](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6964))
- Support polyfilling node globals via `serverNodeBuiltinsPolyfill.globals`/`browserNodeBuiltinsPolyfill.globals` ([#7269](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7269))
- New `redirectDocument` utility to redirect via a fresh document load ([#7040](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7040), [#6842](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6842))
- Add `error` to `meta` params so you can render error titles, etc. ([#7105](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7105))
- `unstable_createRemixStub` now supports adding `meta`/`links` functions on stubbed Remix routes ([#7186](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7186))
  - `unstable_createRemixStub` no longer supports the `element`/`errorElement` properties on routes. You must use `Component`/`ErrorBoundary` to match what you would export from a Remix route module.

## Other Notable Changes

- Remix now uses React Router's `route.lazy` method internally to load route modules on navigations ([#7133](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7133))
- Removed the `@remix-run/node` `atob`/`btoa` polyfills in favor of the built-in versions ([#7206](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7206))
- Decouple the `@remix-run/dev` package from the contents of the `@remix-run/css-bundle` package ([#6982](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/6982))
  - The contents of the `@remix-run/css-bundle` package are now entirely managed by the Remix compiler. Even though it's still recommended that your Remix dependencies all share the same version, this change ensures that there are no runtime errors when upgrading `@remix-run/dev` without upgrading `@remix-run/css-bundle`.
- `remix-serve` now picks an open port if 3000 is taken ([#7278](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7278))
  - If `PORT` env var is set, `remix-serve` will use that port
  - Otherwise, `remix-serve` picks an open port (3000 unless that is already taken)
- Updated dependencies:
  - [`react-router-dom@6.16.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/react-router%406.16.0)
  - [`@remix-run/router@1.9.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/packages/router/CHANGELOG.md#190)
  - [`@remix-run/web-fetch@4.4.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/web-std-io/releases/tag/%40remix-run%2Fweb-fetch%404.4.0)

  - [`@remix-run/web-stream@1.1.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/web-std-io/releases/tag/%40remix-run%2Fweb-stream%401.1.0)
